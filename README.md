# Social Network Analysis â€“ Game of Thrones

## ðŸ“š About the Data

The dataset represents **coappearances of characters** from the Game of Thrones book *A Storm of Swords*.  
- **Type**: Undirected, Weighted Network  
- **Nodes**: Characters in the book  
- **Edges**: Weighted by the number of times two characters appear within 15 words of each other

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.4  
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended via Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Lab)
- Use the `base` environment or your own virtual environment.  
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`, `csv`, `os`, `ipython.display`

### Setup Instructions
1. **Download the repository** and the `material` folder to your local machine.
2. Either:
   - Modify the file paths directly in the notebook, **or**
   - Run the notebook and enter the paths when prompted.
3. Execute the notebook cells in sequential order to complete the analysis.

### Exports & Visualizations
- The notebook will generate `.csv` exports that can be used to **visualize the network graph** in **Gephi** or similar network visualization tools.

## Project Highlights

- Network construction using coappearance weights  
- Degree and betweenness centrality analysis  
- Community detection and clustering  
- Export of network metrics for Gephi compatibility  
- Visual interpretation of character relationships and structural roles in the network
